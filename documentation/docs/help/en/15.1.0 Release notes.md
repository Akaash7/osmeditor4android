# Vespucci 15.1 Highlights

2020-11-XX

### User interface changes and additions

Action modes that require multiple actions are now exited by touching on a floating action button with a check icon instead of via the back button. This effects the way creation mode, creating a relations members, editing a relation and the new create and add to route modes.

All these modes will now further retain state over the Android activity lifecycle.

#### Way creation mode

All additions are now encapsulated in one undo checkpoint, and can be completely undone by one undo operation once the way is created. The undo button visible in the mode will, as previously, remove the last added node, this will however not add extra checkpoints.

#### Create relation mode 

Available from the element (node, way, relation) selection and multi-select modes, now asks you to select a relation type before proceeding. Elements can be added and removed. Clickable elements are filtered, when available, by preset role filters.

#### Add to relation mode

Available from the element (node, way) selection and (NEW) multi-select modes, now asks you to select a relation type before proceeding. Elements can be added and removed (only for elements added in the mode). Clickable elements are filtered, when available, by preset role filters.

#### Edit relation 

#### NEW Create and add to route mode
