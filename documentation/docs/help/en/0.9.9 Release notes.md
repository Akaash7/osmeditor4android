# Vespucci 0.9.9 Highlights

## Indoor Mode

Long pressing the lock icon will cycle through

 * Normal editing mode
 * Tag only mode
 * Indoor editing mode
   
In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesnâ€™t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). 
 
## Changed "Geometry Improvement Handle" behaviour
 
Geometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: 

 * Select way
 * Drag handle (default rendering is a red x)
 * Way remains selected
 * Drag handle
 * .. and so on ...
        
The tradeoff is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.
	
## Tag based filter

The filter can be enable from the normal main menu, the filter can then be changed by tapping the filter icon.
