# Vespucci 0.9.9 Highlights

## Indoor Mode

Long pressing the lock icon will cycle through

 * Normal editing mode
 * Tag only mode
 * Indoor editing mode
   
In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesnâ€™t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). 
 
## Changed "Geometry Improvement Handle" behaviour
 
Geometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: 

 * Select way
 * Drag handle (default rendering is a red x)
 * Way remains selected
 * Drag handle
 * .. and so on ...
        
The tradeoff is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.
	
## Tag based filter

The filter can be enable from the normal main menu, the filter can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found on device or [here](https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/blob/master/documentation/docs/help/en/Tag%20filter.md).

## Miscellaneous 

 * the "Find" search function now supports Photon based geocoders. The default configuration of the OSMF Nominatim and komoots Photon instances can be changed in the advanced preferences.

# Known Problems

* Due to a change in the way Android N handles Uri that reference on device files currently photos that are not in the Vespucci folder cannot be displayed by clicking on them in the photo layer.

# Upgrading from previous Versions
