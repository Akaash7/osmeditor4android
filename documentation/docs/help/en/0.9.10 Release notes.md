# Vespucci 0.9.10 BETA Highlights
 
## Configurable validator
 
The internal validator has been re-factored, among many other changes there is now a check for missing keys and the check for re-surveying introduced in 0.9.9, is now fully configurable.

The missing tag check works on the combination of the keys that should be checked and the preset for element.

Example: the default configuration checks that a "name" tag is present on a object if the matching preset contains a "name" field in the non-optional tags, optionally the check can be extended to "optional" tags.

## C-Mode

In C-Mode only objects that have warnings are displayed, making it simple to find objects with missing tags and other potential problems. Starting the property editor for an object in C-Mode will automatically apply the best match presets.

Currently C-Mode is accessed by cycling through the modes via long press on the "Lock" button. This will likely be replaced by an alternative mechanism for release.

## Miscellaneous 

* The icon for splitting a selected way is now a pair of scissors.
