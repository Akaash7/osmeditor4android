# Vespucci 10.1 BETA Highlights
 
## Under the hood

This release is mainly a clean up release with no major new functionality, but inclusion of projects that were started a while back and some general improvements. There have been some modest performance improvements in both data rendering and with respect to tile retrieval and rendering.

## GPX Waypoints
 
An imported GPX track can now include GPX way points. These can be selected and converted in to OSM Nodes either via manual selection of a preset, or via an automatic search of the term in the GPX "type" fiels in the presets.

## Imagery database, custom imagery and MBTiles

As you may know we use the [Editor Layer Index](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index) for our background and overlay imagery configuration. Previously we re-read and re-parsed the configuration file on every start of vespucci, we now on initial start up and after upgrades store the configuration in a database. This improves start up time considerably. We've further added a method to download updated 
configuration directly from the Editor Layer Index site.

Storing this information in a database was a prerequisite to creating a simple UI to allow custom imagery to be added (there is still a facility to include imagery configuration via a file). While we were at it, we've added support for layers in MBTile format for enhanced offline editing.

## Geo-location sensitive validation

We've done some initial work on providing support for location sensitive validation, currently this is limited to missing "mph" units in speed tags in countries that use such units.

## Miscellaneous 

* In many situations when an empty relation can be created a dialog is shown asking how to proceed.
* In high density areas node touch halos will be reduced as you zoom out.
