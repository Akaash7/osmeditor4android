# Vespucci 介紹

Vespucci is a full featured OpenStreetMap editor that supports most operations that desktop editors provide. It has been tested successfully on Google's Android 2.3 to 7.0 and various AOSP based variants. A word of caution: while mobile device capabilities have caught up with their desktop rivals, particularly older devices have very limited memory available and tend to be rather slow. You should take this in to account when using Vespucci and keep, for example, the areas you are editing to a reasonable size. 

## 第一次使用

在啟動 Vespucci 時為您顯示 "下載其它位置"/"載入區域" 的對話框。如果您有座標顯示並且想要立即下載，您可以選擇合適的選項，和設定想要的下載半徑週圍位置，請不要在緩慢的裝置上選擇大的面積。 

除此之外您可以透過按按鈕解除對話框，並平移與放大位置到想要編輯和下載的資料(見下方："編輯于 Vespucci")。

## 編輯于 Vespucci

根據畫面尺寸和您裝置的新舊，編輯操作可以經由在頂端列的圖示可直接進入，通過下拉選單中頂端列的右側，從底部列(如果存在的話) ，或者透過選單鍵。

### 下載 OSM 資料

Select either the transfer icon ![Transfer](../images/menu_transfer.png) or the "Transfer" menu item. This will display seven options:

* **Download current view** - download the area visible on the screen and replace any existing data *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Add current view to download** - download the area visible on the screen and merge it with existing data *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Download at other location** - shows a form that allows you to enter coordinates, search for a location or use the current position, and then download an area around that location *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Upload data to OSM server** - upload edits to OpenStreetMap *(requires authentication)* *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Auto download** - download an area around the current geographic location automatically *(requires network connectivity)* *(requires GPS)*
* **File...** - saving and loading OSM data to/from on device files.
* **Note/Bugs...** - download (automatically and manually) OSM Notes and "Bugs" from QA tools (currently OSMOSE) *(requires network connectivity)*

The easiest way to download data to the device is to zoom and pan to the location you want to edit and then to select "Download current view". You can zoom by using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the device.  Vespucci should then download data for the current view. No authentication is required for downloading data to your device.

### 編輯

#### Lock, unlock, "tag editing only", indoor mode 

To avoid accidental edits Vespucci starts in "locked" mode, a mode that only allows zooming and moving the map. Tap the ![Locked](../images/locked.png) icon to unlock the screen. 

A long press on the lock icon will enable "Tag editing only" mode which will not allow you to edit the geometry of objects or move them, this mode is indicated with a slightly different white lock icon. You can however create new nodes and ways with a long press as normal.

Another long press will enable [Indoor mode](#indoor), and one more will cycle back to the normal editing mode.

#### Single tap, double tap, and long press

By default, selectable nodes and ways have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. You have three options:

* Single tap: Selects object. 
    * An isolated node/way is highlighted immediately. 
    * However, if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects it will present a selection menu, enabling you to choose the object you wish to select. 
    * Selected objects are highlighted in yellow. 
    * For further information see [Node selected](../en/Node%20selected.md), [Way selected](../en/Way%20selected.md) and [Relation selected](../en/Relation%20selected.md).
* Double tap: Start [Multiselect mode](../en/Multiselect.md)
* Long press: Creates a "crosshair", enabling you to add nodes, see below and [Creating new objects](../en/Creating new objects.md)

如果您試著編輯高密度區域時進行放大，這是一個很好的對策。

Vespucci 擁有一個良好的"取消/重做"系統，所以不要害怕在您的裝置嘗試，但是請不要上傳和儲存純測試資料。

#### Selecting / De-selecting (single tap and "selection menu")

Touch an object to select and highlight it. Touching the screen in an empty region will de-select. If you have selected an object and you need to select something else, simply touch the object in question, there is no need to de-select first. A double tap on an object will start [Multiselect mode](../en/Multiselect.md).

Note that if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects (such as a node on a way or other overlapping objects) it will present a selection menu: Tap the object you wish to select and the object is selected. 

Selected objects are indicated through a thin yellow border. The yellow border may be hard to spot, depending on map background and zoom factor. Once a selection has been made, you will see a notification confirming the selection.

Once the selection has completed you will see (either as buttons or as menu items) a list of supported operations for the selected object: For further information see [Node selected](../en/Node%20selected.md), [Way selected](../en/Way%20selected.md) and [Relation selected](../en/Relation%20selected.md).

#### Selected objects: Editing tags

A second touch on the selected object opens the tag editor and you can edit the tags associated with the object.

Note that for overlapping objects (such as a node on a way) the selection menu comes back up for a second time. Selecting the same object brings up the tag editor; selecting another object simply selects the other object.

#### Selected objects: Moving a Node or Way

Once you have selected an object, it can be moved. Note that objects can be dragged/moved only when they are selected. Simply drag near (i.e. within the tolerance zone of) the selected object to move it. If you select the large drag area in the preferences, you get a large area around the selected node that makes it easier to position the object. 

#### Adding a new Node/Point or Way (long press)

Long press where you want the node to be or the way to start. You will see a black "crosshair" symbol. 
* If you want to create a new node (not connected to an object), click away from existing objects.
* If you want to extend a way, click within the "tolerance zone" of the way (or a node on the way). The tolerance zone is indicated by the areas around a node or way.

Once you can see the crosshair symbol, you have these options:

* Touch in the same place.
    * If the crosshair is not near a node, touching the same location again creates a new node. If you are near a way (but not near a node), the new node will be on the way (and connected to the way).
    * If the crosshair is near a node (i.e. within the tolerance zone of the node), touching the same location just selects the node (and the tag editor opens. No new node is created. The action is the same as the selection above.
* Touch another place. Touching another location (outside of the tolerance zone of the crosshair) adds a way segment from the original position to the current position. If the crosshair was near a way or node, the new segment will be connected to that node or way.

Simply touch the screen where you want to add further nodes of the way. To finish, touch the final node twice. If the final node is  located on a way or node, the segment will be connected to the way or node automatically. 

You can also use a menu item: See [Creating new objects](../en/Creating new objects.md) for more information.

#### 改善道路的幾何形狀

If you zoom in far enough on a selected way you will see a small "x" in the middle of the way segments that are long enough. Dragging the "x" will create a node in the way at that location. Note: to avoid accidentally creating nodes, the touch tolerance area for this operation is fairly small.

#### 剪下、複製和貼上

您可以複製或剪下選擇的節點和路徑，然後貼上一次或多次到一個新的位置。剪切將保留 OSM ID 和版本。要貼上長按要貼上的位置(您會看到一個十字線標記的位置)。然後從選單中選擇“貼上”。

#### 有效的增加地址

Vespucci has an "add address tags" function that tries to make surveying addresses more efficient. It can be selected:

* after a long press: Vespucci will add a node at the location and make a best guess at the house number and add address tags that you have been lately been using. If the node is on a building outline it will automatically add a "entrance=yes" tag to the node. The tag editor will open for the object in question and let you make any necessary further changes.
* in the node/way selected modes: Vespucci will add address tags as above and start the tag editor.
* in the tag editor.

門牌號碼預測，一般需求要在道路的兩側，至少兩間房屋號碼需要輸入到作業中，更多的號碼存在於資料中越好。

Consider using this with the [Auto-download](#download) mode.  

#### 增加轉​​彎限制

Vespucci has a fast way to add turn restrictions. if necessary it will split ways automatically and ask you to re-select elements. 

* select a way with a highway tag (turn restrictions can only be added to highways, if you need to do this for other ways, please use the generic "create relation" mode)
* select "Add restriction" from the menu
* select the "via" node or way (only possible "via" elements will have the touch area shown)
* select the "to" way (it is possible to double back and set the "to" element to the "from" element, Vespucci will assume that you are adding an no_u_turn restriction)
* set the restriction type

### Vespucci"鎖定"模式

當紅色鎖定圖示顯示時，所有非編輯動作都可以做。除此之外，長按或是接近物件時，如果是OSM物件時會顯示詳細資訊視窗

### 儲存您的變更

*(需要網路連線)*

選擇您在下載時相同的按鈕或選單項目，現在選擇 "上傳資料到 OSM 的伺服器"。

Vespucci 除了支援 OAuth 的授權和標準的使用者名稱與密碼的方式。 而 OAuth 更好，因為它避免了以明文發送密碼。

新版Vespucci安裝之後，OAuth會預設啟用。當你第一次要上傳變動的資料，一頁OSM網頁會載入。登入之後(透過加密連線)，你會被要求認證Vespucci才能用你帳號編輯。如果你想要或是需要在編輯前，認證你帳號的OAuth連線，你可以在"工具"選單選擇對應的項目。

如果您想要儲存您的工作，並且不能連入網際網路，您可以儲存成 JOSM 相容的 .osm 檔案，以後以 Vespucci 或 JOSM 任何一個上載。 

#### 在上傳解決衝突

Vespucci有個簡單的衝突解決器。然而，如果你覺得你的編輯有重大的問題，可以匯出你做的變動，匯出為 .osc 檔案。(在"轉移"選單中的"匯出")，之後用JOSM修正上傳。請見[解決衝突](../en/Conflict resolution.md)的詳細說明。  

## 使用 GPS

您可用 Vespucci 建立 GPX 軌跡和顯示在您的裝置上。進一步此外，您可顯示目前 GPS 位置，(在 GPS 選單中設定"顯示位置")具有螢幕中心周圍和追隨的位置，(在 GPS 選單中設定"追隨 GPS 位置")。 

If you have the latter set, moving the screen manually or editing will cause the "follow GPS" mode to be disabled and the blue GPS arrow will change from an outline to a filled arrow. To quickly return to the "follow" mode, simply touch GPS button or re-check the menu option.

## 備註和錯誤

Vespucci支援下載、回應或是關閉OSM註解(先前叫做OSM臭蟲)，相當於[OSMOSE 品質管控工具](http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/)列出的"臭蟲"。兩者都可以完整下載下來，或者使用自動下載工具看到你的區域內的註解。一旦你回應或是關閉註解，你可以上傳單一臭蟲還是註解，或是一次上傳多個註解。

On the map the Notes and bugs are represented by a small bug icon ![Bug](../images/bug_open.png), green ones are closed/resolved, blue ones have been created or edited by you, and yellow indicates that it is still active and hasn't been changed. 

OSMOSE臭蟲則會將受影響的物件顯示為藍色連結，碰觸連結則會選取物件，並且螢幕置中，如果需要則會下載周邊的區域。 

### Filtering

Besides globally enabling the notes and bugs display you can set a coarse grain display filter to reduce clutter. In the "Advanced preferences" you can individually select:

* Notes
* Osmose error
* Osmose warning
* Osmose minor issue

<a id="indoor"></a>

## Indoor mode

Mapping indoors is challenging due to the high number of objects that very often will overlay each other. Vespucci has a dedicated indoor mode that allows you to filter out all objects that are not on the same level and which will automatically add the current level to new objects created their.

The mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see [Lock, unlock, "tag editing only", indoor mode](#lock).

## Filters

### Tag based filter

The filter can be enabled from the main menu, it can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found here [Tag filter](../en/Tag%20filter.md).

### Preset based filter

An alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group). More documentation can be found here [Preset filter](../en/Preset%20filter.md).

## 客製化 Vespucci

### 設定，當您可能想要更改

* Background layer
* Overlay layer. Adding an overlay may cause issues with older devices and such with limited memory. Default: none.
* Notes/Bugs display. Open Notes and bugs will be displayed as a yellow bug icon, closed ones the same in green. Default: on.
* Photo layer. Displays georeferenced photographs as red camera icons, if direction information is available the icon will be rotated. Default: off.
* Node icons. Default: on.
* Keep screen on. Default: off.
* Large node drag area. Moving nodes on a device with touch input is problematic since your fingers will obscure the current position on the display. Turning this on will provide a large area which can be used for off-center dragging (selection and other operations still use the normal touch tolerance area). Default: off.

進階參數選項

* Always show context menu. When turned on every selection process will show the context menu, turned off the menu is displayed only when no unambiguous selection can be determined. Default: off (used to be on).
* Enable light theme. On modern devices this is turned on by default. While you can enable it for older Android versions the style is likely to be inconsistent.
* Show statistics. Will show some statistics for debugging, not really useful. Default: off (used to be on).  

## 回報問題
