# Vespucci 소개

Vespucci is a full featured OpenStreetMap editor that supports most operations that desktop editors provide. It has been tested successfully on Google's Android 2.3 to 7.0 and various AOSP based variants. A word of caution: while mobile device capabilities have caught up with their desktop rivals, particularly older devices have very limited memory available and tend to be rather slow. You should take this in to account when using Vespucci and keep, for example, the areas you are editing to a reasonable size. 

## 첫번째 사용

시작시 Vespucci는 "다른 위치 다운로드"/"지역 불러오기" 대화 상자를 보여줍니다. 좌표가 표시되고 즉시 다운로드하려는 경우 적절한 옵션을 선택하고 다운로드할 위치 주변의 반지름을 설정할 수 있습니다. 느린 장치에서는 넓은 영역을 선택하지 마십시오. 

또는 "지도로 가기"버튼을 눌러 대화 상자를 닫고 편집 할 위치로 이동하여 확대 / 축소 한 다음 데이터를 다운로드 할 수 있습니다 (아래의 "Vespucci로 편집하기"참조).

## Vespucci로 편집하기

기기의 화면 크기와 나이에 따라 상단 바의 아이콘, 상단 바 오른쪽의 드롭 다운 메뉴, 하단 바 (있는 경우) 또는 메뉴 키를 통해 편집 작업에 직접 액세스 할 수 있습니다.

### OSM 데이터 다운로드하기

Select either the transfer icon ![Transfer](../images/menu_transfer.png) or the "Transfer" menu item. This will display seven options:

* **Download current view** - download the area visible on the screen and replace any existing data *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Add current view to download** - download the area visible on the screen and merge it with existing data *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Download at other location** - shows a form that allows you to enter coordinates, search for a location or use the current position, and then download an area around that location *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Upload data to OSM server** - upload edits to OpenStreetMap *(requires authentication)* *(requires network connectivity)*
* **Auto download** - download an area around the current geographic location automatically *(requires network connectivity)* *(requires GPS)*
* **File...** - saving and loading OSM data to/from on device files.
* **Note/Bugs...** - download (automatically and manually) OSM Notes and "Bugs" from QA tools (currently OSMOSE) *(requires network connectivity)*

The easiest way to download data to the device is to zoom and pan to the location you want to edit and then to select "Download current view". You can zoom by using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the device.  Vespucci should then download data for the current view. No authentication is required for downloading data to your device.

### 편집하기

<a id="lock"></a>

#### Lock, unlock, "tag editing only", indoor mode 

실수로 편집하는 것을 막기 위해서 Vespucci가 "잠금"모드를 활성화 하였습니다. 확대 및 축소와 지도를 움직이는 것만 허용됩니다. ![Locked](../images/locked.png) 아이콘을 누르면 잠금해제를 할 수 있습니다. 

A long press on the lock icon will enable "Tag editing only" mode which will not allow you to edit the geometry of objects or move them, this mode is indicated with a slightly different white lock icon. You can however create new nodes and ways with a long press as normal.

Another long press will enable [Indoor mode](#indoor), and one more will cycle back to the normal editing mode.

#### Single tap, double tap, and long press

By default, selectable nodes and ways have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. You have three options:

* Single tap: Selects object. 
    * An isolated node/way is highlighted immediately. 
    * However, if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects it will present a selection menu, enabling you to choose the object you wish to select. 
    * Selected objects are highlighted in yellow. 
    * For further information see [Node selected](../en/Node%20selected.md), [Way selected](../en/Way%20selected.md) and [Relation selected](../en/Relation%20selected.md).
* Double tap: Start [Multiselect mode](../en/Multiselect.md)
* Long press: Creates a "crosshair", enabling you to add nodes, see below and [Creating new objects](../en/Creating new objects.md)

It is a good strategy to zoom in if you attempt to edit a high density area.

Vespucci has a good "undo/redo" system so don't be afraid of experimenting on your device, however please do not upload and save pure test data.

#### Selecting / De-selecting (single tap and "selection menu")

Touch an object to select and highlight it. Touching the screen in an empty region will de-select. If you have selected an object and you need to select something else, simply touch the object in question, there is no need to de-select first. A double tap on an object will start [Multiselect mode](../en/Multiselect.md).

Note that if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects (such as a node on a way or other overlapping objects) it will present a selection menu: Tap the object you wish to select and the object is selected. 

Selected objects are indicated through a thin yellow border. The yellow border may be hard to spot, depending on map background and zoom factor. Once a selection has been made, you will see a notification confirming the selection.

Once the selection has completed you will see (either as buttons or as menu items) a list of supported operations for the selected object: For further information see [Node selected](../en/Node%20selected.md), [Way selected](../en/Way%20selected.md) and [Relation selected](../en/Relation%20selected.md).

#### Selected objects: Editing tags

A second touch on the selected object opens the tag editor and you can edit the tags associated with the object.

Note that for overlapping objects (such as a node on a way) the selection menu comes back up for a second time. Selecting the same object brings up the tag editor; selecting another object simply selects the other object.

#### Selected objects: Moving a Node or Way

Once you have selected an object, it can be moved. Note that objects can be dragged/moved only when they are selected. Simply drag near (i.e. within the tolerance zone of) the selected object to move it. If you select the large drag area in the preferences, you get a large area around the selected node that makes it easier to position the object. 

#### Adding a new Node/Point or Way (long press)

Long press where you want the node to be or the way to start. You will see a black "crosshair" symbol. 
* If you want to create a new node (not connected to an object), click away from existing objects.
* If you want to extend a way, click within the "tolerance zone" of the way (or a node on the way). The tolerance zone is indicated by the areas around a node or way.

Once you can see the crosshair symbol, you have these options:

* Touch in the same place.
    * If the crosshair is not near a node, touching the same location again creates a new node. If you are near a way (but not near a node), the new node will be on the way (and connected to the way).
    * If the crosshair is near a node (i.e. within the tolerance zone of the node), touching the same location just selects the node (and the tag editor opens. No new node is created. The action is the same as the selection above.
* Touch another place. Touching another location (outside of the tolerance zone of the crosshair) adds a way segment from the original position to the current position. If the crosshair was near a way or node, the new segment will be connected to that node or way.

Simply touch the screen where you want to add further nodes of the way. To finish, touch the final node twice. If the final node is  located on a way or node, the segment will be connected to the way or node automatically. 

You can also use a menu item: See [Creating new objects](../en/Creating new objects.md) for more information.

#### 길 기하적 개선하기

If you zoom in far enough on a selected way you will see a small "x" in the middle of the way segments that are long enough. Dragging the "x" will create a node in the way at that location. Note: to avoid accidentally creating nodes, the touch tolerance area for this operation is fairly small.

#### 잘라내기, 복사 및 붙여넣기

You can copy or cut selected nodes and ways, and then paste once or multiple times to a new location. Cutting will retain the osm id and version. To paste long press the location you want to paste to (you will see a cross hair marking the location). Then select "Paste" from the menu.

#### 효율적으로 주소 추가하기

Vespucci has an "add address tags" function that tries to make surveying addresses more efficient. It can be selected:

* after a long press: Vespucci will add a node at the location and make a best guess at the house number and add address tags that you have been lately been using. If the node is on a building outline it will automatically add a "entrance=yes" tag to the node. The tag editor will open for the object in question and let you make any necessary further changes.
* in the node/way selected modes: Vespucci will add address tags as above and start the tag editor.
* in the tag editor.

House number prediction typically requires at least two house numbers on each side of the road to be entered to work, the more numbers present in the data the better.

Consider using this with the [Auto-download](#download) mode.  

#### 회전 제한 추가하기

Vespucci has a fast way to add turn restrictions. if necessary it will split ways automatically and ask you to re-select elements. 

* select a way with a highway tag (turn restrictions can only be added to highways, if you need to do this for other ways, please use the generic "create relation" mode)
* select "Add restriction" from the menu
* select the "via" node or way (only possible "via" elements will have the touch area shown)
* select the "to" way (it is possible to double back and set the "to" element to the "from" element, Vespucci will assume that you are adding an no_u_turn restriction)
* set the restriction type

### "잠금" 모드헤서의 Vespucci

When the red lock is displayed all non-editing actions are available. Additionally a long press on or near to an object will display the detail information screen if it is an OSM object.

### 변경사항 저장하기

*(requires network connectivity)*

Select the same button or menu item you did for the download and now select "Upload data to OSM server".

Vespucci supports OAuth authorization and the classical username and password method. OAuth is preferable since it avoids sending passwords in the clear.

New Vespucci installs will have OAuth enabled by default. On your first attempt to upload modified data, a page from the OSM website loads. After you have logged on (over an encrypted connection) you will be asked to authorize Vespucci to edit using your account. If you want to or need to authorize the OAuth access to your account before editing there is a corresponding item in the "Tools" menu.

If you want to save your work and do not have Internet access, you can save to a JOSM compatible .osm file and either upload later with Vespucci or with JOSM. 

#### 업로드에서 충돌 해결하기

Vespucci has a simple conflict resolver. However if you suspect that there are major issues with your edits, export your changes to a .osc file ("Export" menu item in the "Transfer" menu) and fix and upload them with JOSM. See the detailed help on [conflict resolution](../en/Conflict resolution.md).  

## GPS 사용하기

You can use Vespucci to create a GPX track and display it on your device. Further you can display the current GPS position (set "Show location" in the GPS menu) and/or have the screen center around and follow the position (set "Follow GPS Position" in the GPS menu). 

If you have the latter set, moving the screen manually or editing will cause the "follow GPS" mode to be disabled and the blue GPS arrow will change from an outline to a filled arrow. To quickly return to the "follow" mode, simply touch GPS button or re-check the menu option.

## 참고와 버그

Vespucci supports downloading, commenting and closing of OSM Notes (formerly OSM Bugs) and the equivalent functionality for "Bugs" produced by the [OSMOSE quality assurance tool](http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/). Both have to either be downloaded explicitly or you can use the auto download facility to access the items in your immediate area. Once edited or closed, you can either upload the bug or Note immediately or upload all at once.

On the map the Notes and bugs are represented by a small bug icon ![Bug](../images/bug_open.png), green ones are closed/resolved, blue ones have been created or edited by you, and yellow indicates that it is still active and hasn't been changed. 

The OSMOSE bug display will provide a link to the affected object in blue, touching the link will select the object, center the screen on it and down load the area beforehand if necessary. 

### Filtering

Besides globally enabling the notes and bugs display you can set a coarse grain display filter to reduce clutter. In the "Advanced preferences" you can individually select:

* Notes
* Osmose error
* Osmose warning
* Osmose minor issue

<a id="indoor"></a>

## Indoor mode

Mapping indoors is challenging due to the high number of objects that very often will overlay each other. Vespucci has a dedicated indoor mode that allows you to filter out all objects that are not on the same level and which will automatically add the current level to new objects created their.

The mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see [Lock, unlock, "tag editing only", indoor mode](#lock).

## Filters

### Tag based filter

The filter can be enabled from the main menu, it can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found here [Tag filter](../en/Tag%20filter.md).

### Preset based filter

An alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group). More documentation can be found here [Preset filter](../en/Preset%20filter.md).

## Vespucci 사용자 지정

### 변경하고자 하는 설정

* Background layer
* Overlay layer. Adding an overlay may cause issues with older devices and such with limited memory. Default: none.
* Notes/Bugs display. Open Notes and bugs will be displayed as a yellow bug icon, closed ones the same in green. Default: on.
* Photo layer. Displays georeferenced photographs as red camera icons, if direction information is available the icon will be rotated. Default: off.
* Node icons. Default: on.
* Keep screen on. Default: off.
* Large node drag area. Moving nodes on a device with touch input is problematic since your fingers will obscure the current position on the display. Turning this on will provide a large area which can be used for off-center dragging (selection and other operations still use the normal touch tolerance area). Default: off.

#### 고급 환경 설정

* Always show context menu. When turned on every selection process will show the context menu, turned off the menu is displayed only when no unambiguous selection can be determined. Default: off (used to be on).
* Enable light theme. On modern devices this is turned on by default. While you can enable it for older Android versions the style is likely to be inconsistent.
* Show statistics. Will show some statistics for debugging, not really useful. Default: off (used to be on).
