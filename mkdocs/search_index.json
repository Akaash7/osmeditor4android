            "text": "Vespucci Introduction\n\n\nVespucci is a full featured OpenStreetMap editor that supports most operations that desktop editors provide. It has been tested successfully on Google's Android 2.3 to 7.0 and various AOSP based variants. A word of caution: while mobile device capabilities have caught up with their desktop rivals, particularly older devices have very limited memory available and tend to be rather slow. You should take this in to account when using Vespucci and keep, for example, the areas you are editing to a reasonable size. \n\n\nFirst time use\n\n\nOn startup Vespucci shows you the \"Download other location\"/\"Load Area\" dialog. If you have coordinates displayed and want to download immediately, you can select the appropriate option and set the radius around the location that you want to download. Do not select a large area on slow devices. \n\n\nAlternatively you can dismiss the dialog by pressing the \"Go to map\" button and pan and zoom to a location you want to edit and download the data then (see below: \"Editing with Vespucci\").\n\n\nEditing with Vespucci\n\n\nDepending on screen size and age of your device editing actions may either be accessible directly via icons in the top bar, via a drop down menu on the right of the top bar, from the bottom bar (if present) or via the menu key.\n\n\n\n\nDownloading OSM Data\n\n\nSelect either the transfer icon \n or the \"Transfer\" menu item. This will display seven options:\n\n\n\n\nDownload current view\n - download the area visible on the screen and replace any existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAdd current view to download\n - download the area visible on the screen and merge it with existing data \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nDownload at other location\n - shows a form that allows you to enter coordinates, search for a location or use the current position, and then download an area around that location \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nUpload data to OSM server\n - upload edits to OpenStreetMap \n(requires authentication)\n \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nAuto download\n - download an area around the current geographic location automatically \n(requires network connectivity)\n \n(requires GPS)\n\n\nFile...\n - saving and loading OSM data to/from on device files.\n\n\nNote/Bugs...\n - download (automatically and manually) OSM Notes and \"Bugs\" from QA tools (currently OSMOSE) \n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to download data to the device is to zoom and pan to the location you want to edit and then to select \"Download current view\". You can zoom by using gestures, the zoom buttons or the volume control buttons on the device.  Vespucci should then download data for the current view. No authentication is required for downloading data to your device.\n\n\nEditing\n\n\n\n\nLock, unlock, mode switching\n\n\nTo avoid accidental edits Vespucci starts in \"locked\" mode, a mode that only allows zooming and moving the map. Tap the \n icon to unlock the screen. \n\n\nA long press on the lock icon will display a menu currently offering 4 options:\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n - the default editing mode, new objects can be added, existing ones edited, moved and removed. Simple white lock icon displayed.\n\n\nTag only\n - selecting an existing object will start the Property Editor, a long press on the main screen will add objects, but no other geometry operations will work. White lock icon with a \"T\" is displayed.\n\n\nIndoor\n - enables Indoor mode, see \nIndoor mode\n. White lock icon with a \"I\" is displayed.\n\n\nC-Mode\n - enables C-Mode, only objects that have a warning flag set will be displayed, see \nC-Mode\n. White lock icon with a \"C\" is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nSingle tap, double tap, and long press\n\n\nBy default, selectable nodes and ways have an orange area around them indicating roughly where you have to touch to select an object. You have three options:\n\n\n\n\nSingle tap: Selects object. \n\n\nAn isolated node/way is highlighted immediately. \n\n\nHowever, if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects it will present a selection menu, enabling you to choose the object you wish to select. \n\n\nSelected objects are highlighted in yellow. \n\n\nFor further information see \nNode selected\n, \nWay selected\n and \nRelation selected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble tap: Start \nMultiselect mode\n\n\nLong press: Creates a \"crosshair\", enabling you to add nodes, see below and \nCreating new objects\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good strategy to zoom in if you attempt to edit a high density area.\n\n\nVespucci has a good \"undo/redo\" system so don't be afraid of experimenting on your device, however please do not upload and save pure test data.\n\n\nSelecting / De-selecting (single tap and \"selection menu\")\n\n\nTouch an object to select and highlight it. Touching the screen in an empty region will de-select. If you have selected an object and you need to select something else, simply touch the object in question, there is no need to de-select first. A double tap on an object will start \nMultiselect mode\n.\n\n\nNote that if you try to select an object and Vespucci determines that the selection could mean multiple objects (such as a node on a way or other overlapping objects) it will present a selection menu: Tap the object you wish to select and the object is selected. \n\n\nSelected objects are indicated through a thin yellow border. The yellow border may be hard to spot, depending on map background and zoom factor. Once a selection has been made, you will see a notification confirming the selection.\n\n\nOnce the selection has completed you will see (either as buttons or as menu items) a list of supported operations for the selected object: For further information see \nNode selected\n, \nWay selected\n and \nRelation selected\n.\n\n\nSelected objects: Editing tags\n\n\nA second touch on the selected object opens the tag editor and you can edit the tags associated with the object.\n\n\nNote that for overlapping objects (such as a node on a way) the selection menu comes back up for a second time. Selecting the same object brings up the tag editor; selecting another object simply selects the other object.\n\n\nSelected objects: Moving a Node or Way\n\n\nOnce you have selected an object, it can be moved. Note that objects can be dragged/moved only when they are selected. Simply drag near (i.e. within the tolerance zone of) the selected object to move it. If you select the large drag area in the preferences, you get a large area around the selected node that makes it easier to position the object. \n\n\nAdding a new Node/Point or Way (long press)\n\n\nLong press where you want the node to be or the way to start. You will see a black \"crosshair\" symbol. \n\n If you want to create a new node (not connected to an object), click away from existing objects.\n\n If you want to extend a way, click within the \"tolerance zone\" of the way (or a node on the way). The tolerance zone is indicated by the areas around a node or way.\n\n\nOnce you can see the crosshair symbol, you have these options:\n\n\n\n\nTouch in the same place.\n\n\nIf the crosshair is not near a node, touching the same location again creates a new node. If you are near a way (but not near a node), the new node will be on the way (and connected to the way).\n\n\nIf the crosshair is near a node (i.e. within the tolerance zone of the node), touching the same location just selects the node (and the tag editor opens. No new node is created. The action is the same as the selection above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTouch another place. Touching another location (outside of the tolerance zone of the crosshair) adds a way segment from the original position to the current position. If the crosshair was near a way or node, the new segment will be connected to that node or way.\n\n\n\n\nSimply touch the screen where you want to add further nodes of the way. To finish, touch the final node twice. If the final node is  located on a way or node, the segment will be connected to the way or node automatically. \n\n\nYou can also use a menu item: See \nCreating new objects\n for more information.\n\n\nAdding an Area\n\n\nOpenStreetMap currently doesn't have an \"area\" object type unlike other geo-data systems. The online editor \"iD\" tries to create an area abstraction from the underlying OSM elements which works well in some circumstances, in others not so. Vespucci currently doesn't try to do anything similar, so you need to know a bit about the way areas are represented:\n\n\n\n\nclosed ways (*polygons\")\n: the simplest and most common area variant, are ways that have a shared first and last node forming a closed \"ring\" (for example most buildings are of this type). These are very easy to create in Vespucci, simply connect back to the first node when you are finished with drawing the area. Note: the interpretation of the closed way depends on its tagging: for example if a closed way is tagged as a building it will be considered an area, if it is tagged as a roundabout it wont. In some situations in which both interpretations may be valid, an \"area\" tag can clarify the intended use.\n\n\nmulti-ploygons\n: some areas have multiple parts, holes and rings that can't be represented with just one way. OSM uses a specific type of relation (our general purpose object that can model relations between elements) to get around this, a multi-polygon. A multi-polygon can have multiple \"outer\" rings, and multiple \"inner\" rings. Each ring can either be a closed way as described above, or multiple individual ways that have common end nodes. While large multi-polygons are difficult to handle with any tool, small ones are not difficult to create in Vespucci. \n\n\ncoastlines\n: for very large objects, continents and islands, even the multi-polygon model doesn't work in a satisfactory way. For natural=coastline ways we assume direction dependent semantics: the land is on the left side of the way, the water on the right side. A side effect of this is that, in general, you shouldn't reverse the direction of a way with coastline tagging. More information can be found on the \nOSM wiki\n.\n\n\n\n\nImproving Way Geometry\n\n\nIf you zoom in far enough on a selected way you will see a small \"x\" in the middle of the way segments that are long enough. Dragging the \"x\" will create a node in the way at that location. Note: to avoid accidentally creating nodes, the touch tolerance area for this operation is fairly small.\n\n\nCut, Copy \n Paste\n\n\nYou can copy or cut selected nodes and ways, and then paste once or multiple times to a new location. Cutting will retain the osm id and version. To paste long press the location you want to paste to (you will see a cross hair marking the location). Then select \"Paste\" from the menu.\n\n\nEfficiently Adding Addresses\n\n\nVespucci has an \"add address tags\" function that tries to make surveying addresses more efficient. It can be selected:\n\n\n\n\nafter a long press: Vespucci will add a node at the location and make a best guess at the house number and add address tags that you have been lately been using. If the node is on a building outline it will automatically add a \"entrance=yes\" tag to the node. The tag editor will open for the object in question and let you make any necessary further changes.\n\n\nin the node/way selected modes: Vespucci will add address tags as above and start the tag editor.\n\n\nin the tag editor.\n\n\n\n\nHouse number prediction typically requires at least two house numbers on each side of the road to be entered to work, the more numbers present in the data the better.\n\n\nConsider using this with the \nAuto-download\n mode.  \n\n\nAdding Turn Restrictions\n\n\nVespucci has a fast way to add turn restrictions. if necessary it will split ways automatically and ask you to re-select elements. \n\n\n\n\nselect a way with a highway tag (turn restrictions can only be added to highways, if you need to do this for other ways, please use the generic \"create relation\" mode)\n\n\nselect \"Add restriction\" from the menu\n\n\nselect the \"via\" node or way (only possible \"via\" elements will have the touch area shown)\n\n\nselect the \"to\" way (it is possible to double back and set the \"to\" element to the \"from\" element, Vespucci will assume that you are adding an no_u_turn restriction)\n\n\nset the restriction type\n\n\n\n\nVespucci in \"locked\" mode\n\n\nWhen the red lock is displayed all non-editing actions are available. Additionally a long press on or near to an object will display the detail information screen if it is an OSM object.\n\n\nSaving Your Changes\n\n\n(requires network connectivity)\n\n\nSelect the same button or menu item you did for the download and now select \"Upload data to OSM server\".\n\n\nVespucci supports OAuth authorization and the classical username and password method. OAuth is preferable since it avoids sending passwords in the clear.\n\n\nNew Vespucci installs will have OAuth enabled by default. On your first attempt to upload modified data, a page from the OSM website loads. After you have logged on (over an encrypted connection) you will be asked to authorize Vespucci to edit using your account. If you want to or need to authorize the OAuth access to your account before editing there is a corresponding item in the \"Tools\" menu.\n\n\nIf you want to save your work and do not have Internet access, you can save to a JOSM compatible .osm file and either upload later with Vespucci or with JOSM. \n\n\nResolving conflicts on uploads\n\n\nVespucci has a simple conflict resolver. However if you suspect that there are major issues with your edits, export your changes to a .osc file (\"Export\" menu item in the \"Transfer\" menu) and fix and upload them with JOSM. See the detailed help on \nconflict resolution\n.  \n\n\nUsing GPS\n\n\nYou can use Vespucci to create a GPX track and display it on your device. Further you can display the current GPS position (set \"Show location\" in the GPS menu) and/or have the screen center around and follow the position (set \"Follow GPS Position\" in the GPS menu). \n\n\nIf you have the latter set, moving the screen manually or editing will cause the \"follow GPS\" mode to be disabled and the blue GPS arrow will change from an outline to a filled arrow. To quickly return to the \"follow\" mode, simply touch GPS button or re-check the menu option.\n\n\nNotes and Bugs\n\n\nVespucci supports downloading, commenting and closing of OSM Notes (formerly OSM Bugs) and the equivalent functionality for \"Bugs\" produced by the \nOSMOSE quality assurance tool\n. Both have to either be down loaded explicitly or you can use the auto download facility to access the items in your immediate area. Once edited or closed, you can either upload the bug or Note immediately or upload all at once.\n\n\nOn the map the Notes and bugs are represented by a small bug icon \n, green ones are closed/resolved, blue ones have been created or edited by you, and yellow indicates that it is still active and hasn't been changed. \n\n\nThe OSMOSE bug display will provide a link to the affected object in blue, touching the link will select the object, center the screen on it and down load the area beforehand if necessary. \n\n\nFiltering\n\n\nBesides globally enabling the notes and bugs display you can set a coarse grain display filter to reduce clutter. In the \"Advanced preferences\" you can individually select:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nOsmose error\n\n\nOsmose warning\n\n\nOsmose minor issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndoor mode\n\n\nMapping indoors is challenging due to the high number of objects that very often will overlay each other. Vespucci has a dedicated indoor mode that allows you to filter out all objects that are not on the same level and which will automatically add the current level to new objects created their.\n\n\nThe mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see \nLock, unlock, mode switching\n and selecting the corresponding menu entry.\n\n\n\n\nC-Mode\n\n\nIn C-Mode only objects are displayed that have a warning flag set, this makes it easy to spot objects that have specific problems or match configurable checks. If an object is selected and the Property Editor started in C-Mode the best matching preset will automatically be applied.\n\n\nThe mode can be enabled by long pressing on the lock item, see \nLock, unlock, mode switching\n and selecting the corresponding menu entry.\n\n\nConfiguring checks\n\n\nCurrently there are two configurable checks (there is a check for FIXME tags and a test for missing type tags on relations that are currently not configurable) both can be configured by selecting \"Validator preferences\" in the \"Preferences\". \n\n\nThe list of entries is split in to two, the top half lists \"re-survey\" entries, the bottom half \"check entries\". Entries can be edited by clicking them, the green menu button allows adding of entries.\n\n\nRe-survey entries\n\n\nRe-survey entries have the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nKey\n - Key of the tag of interest.\n\n\nValue\n - Value the tag of interest should have, if empty the tag value will be ignored.\n\n\nAge\n - how many days after the element was last changed the element should be re-surveyed, if a check_date field is present that will be the used, otherwise the date the current version was create. Setting the value to zero will lead to the check simply matching against key and value.\n\n\nRegular expression\n - if checked \nValue\n is assumed to be a JAVA regular expression.\n\n\n\n\nKey\n and \nValue\n are checked against the \nexisting\n tags of the object in question.\n\n\nCheck entries\n\n\nCheck entries have the following two properties:\n\n\n\n\nKey\n - Key that should be present on the object according to the matching preset.\n\n\nCheck optional\n - Check the optional tags of the matching preset.\n\n\n\n\nThis check works be first determining the matching preset and then checking if \nKey\n is a \"recommended\" key for this object according to the preset, \nCheck optional\n will expand the check to tags that are \"optional* on the object. Note: currently linked presets are not checked.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nTag based filter\n\n\nThe filter can be enabled from the main menu, it can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found here \nTag filter\n.\n\n\nPreset based filter\n\n\nAn alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group). More documentation can be found here \nPreset filter\n.\n\n\nCustomizing Vespucci\n\n\nSettings that you might want to change\n\n\n\n\nBackground layer\n\n\nOverlay layer. Adding an overlay may cause issues with older devices and such with limited memory. Default: none.\n\n\nNotes/Bugs display. Open Notes and bugs will be displayed as a yellow bug icon, closed ones the same in green. Default: on.\n\n\nPhoto layer. Displays geo-referenced photographs as red camera icons, if direction information is available the icon will be rotated. Default: off.\n\n\nNode icons. Default: on.\n\n\nKeep screen on. Default: off.\n\n\nLarge node drag area. Moving nodes on a device with touch input is problematic since your fingers will obscure the current position on the display. Turning this on will provide a large area which can be used for off-center dragging (selection and other operations still use the normal touch tolerance area). Default: off.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced preferences\n\n\n\n\nAlways show context menu. When turned on every selection process will show the context menu, turned off the menu is displayed only when no unambiguous selection can be determined. Default: off (used to be on).\n\n\nEnable light theme. On modern devices this is turned on by default. While you can enable it for older Android versions the style is likely to be inconsistent.\n\n\nShow statistics. Will show some statistics for debugging, not really useful. Default: off (used to be on).  \n\n\n\n\nReporting Problems\n\n\nIf Vespucci crashes, or it detects an inconsistent state, you will be asked to send in the crash dump. Please do so if that happens, but please only once per specific situation. If you want to give further input or open an issue for a feature request or similar, please do so here: \nVespucci issue tracker\n. If you want to discuss something related to Vespucci, you can either start a discussion on the \nVespucci Google group\n or on the \nOpenStreetMap Android forum",

The online editor \"iD\" tries to create an area abstraction from the underlying OSM elements which works well in some circumstances, in others not so. Vespucci currently doesn't try to do anything similar, so you need to know a bit about the way areas are represented:   closed ways (*polygons\") : the simplest and most common area variant, are ways that have a shared first and last node forming a closed \"ring\" (for example most buildings are of this type). These are very easy to create in Vespucci, simply connect back to the first node when you are finished with drawing the area. Note: the interpretation of the closed way depends on its tagging: for example if a closed way is tagged as a building it will be considered an area, if it is tagged as a roundabout it wont. In some situations in which both interpretations may be valid, an \"area\" tag can clarify the intended use.  multi-ploygons : some areas have multiple parts, holes and rings that can't be represented with just one way. OSM uses a specific type of relation (our general purpose object that can model relations between elements) to get around this, a multi-polygon. A multi-polygon can have multiple \"outer\" rings, and multiple \"inner\" rings. Each ring can either be a closed way as described above, or multiple individual ways that have common end nodes. While large multi-polygons are difficult to handle with any tool, small ones are not difficult to create in Vespucci.   coastlines : for very large objects, continents and islands, even the multi-polygon model doesn't work in a satisfactory way. For natural=coastline ways we assume direction dependent semantics: the land is on the left side of the way, the water on the right side. A side effect of this is that, in general, you shouldn't reverse the direction of a way with coastline tagging. More information can be found on the  OSM wiki .",

The problem with this is that these days nobody understands if you are not at at least at version 3 after a couple of months and people may actually think something is wrong, so we've decided to do a Mozilla and jump to version 10. \n\n\nWhile semantic versioning doesn't really make a lot of sense for applications that don't expose an API, we will be sticking with a \nmajor\n . \nminor\n . \npatch\n system for the internal numbering for now.\n\n\nConfigurable validator\n\n\nThe internal validator has been re-factored, among many other changes there is now a check for missing keys and the check for re-surveying, introduced in 0.9.9, is now fully configurable.\n\n\nThe missing tag check works on the combination of the keys that should be checked and the preset for element.\n\n\nExample: the default configuration checks that a \"name\" tag is present on a object if the matching preset contains a \"name\" field in the non-optional tags, optionally the check can be extended to \"optional\" tags.\n\n\nC-Mode\n\n\nIn C-Mode only objects that have warnings are displayed, making it simple to find objects with missing tags and other potential problems. Starting the property editor for an object in C-Mode will automatically apply the best match presets.\n\n\nCycling through modes by long pressing on the lock button has become impractical with the increasing number of modes and has now been replaced with a menu.\n\n\nSupport for synonyms in the preset search\n\n\nThe preset search will now use the same list of synonyms that the iD editor does additionally to the internal preset search index. The new functionality is independent of preset translations and uses the same fuzzy matching as the index search. Additional synonyms should be added on transifex to the \niD translations\n.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\nthe search will currently only find presets that are present both in iD and Vespucci, we may consider added Vespucci specific lists at a later time.\n\n\nsynonyms for military terms have been removed for safety reasons.\n\n\n\n\nSupport for custom tasks\n\n\nYou can now load (and save) tasks in a simplified Osmose JSON format. The format is not particularly forgiving and must follow the following example:\n\n\n{\n    \"description\": [\n        \"lat\",\n        \"lon\",\n        \"error_id\",\n        \"elems\",\n        \"subtitle\",\n        \"title\",\n        \"level\",\n        \"update\"\n    ],\n    \"errors\": [\n        [\n            \"47.3050383\",\n            \"8.3702817\",\n            \"11187837418\",\n            \"way396965872\",\n            \"This is a silly error of type 1\",\n            \"Silly Errors\",\n            \"2\",\n            \"2017-03-26 20:30:16+02:00\"\n        ],\n        [\n            \"47.2930434\",\n            \"8.3615897\",\n            \"11187837446\",\n            \"way397334779\",\n            \"This is a silly error of type 2\",\n            \"Silly Errors\",\n            \"2\",\n            \"2017-03-26 20:30:16+02:00\"\n        ]\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\nThe value for \"error_id\" should be unique in the file. Note the custom tasks can't be uploaded, however you can save the open tasks to a file for later reuse.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\nThe icon for splitting a selected way is now a pair of scissors.\n\n\nImproved label rendering.\n\n\nIf a PresetFilter is filtering just on one preset item, apply that automatically when creating new elements.\n\n\nSupport i18n attribute in presets to indicate that a text field can have i18n suffixes\n\n\nImproved tile download behavior when zooming or switching layers.\n\n\nSupport for object_keys and value_type attributes in presets (current value_type opening_hours, conditional, and website are supported).\n\n\nSupport for using patterns for way rendering, added styling for natural=cliff, natural=coastline and man_made=embankment.\n\n\nImproved conditional restriction editor with opening_hours editor support.\n\n\n\n\nThe full change log is available \nhere\n\n\nKnown problems\n\n\nUpgrading from previous versions\n\n\n\n\nThe saved editing state file format has changed, please complete any edits before upgrading.\n\n\n\n\nThe preference values for numerical \"Advanced preferences\" have been reset to their defaults.

Even as is, we cannot use the latest version of these libraries that would match the Android version we are building against.\n\n\nAs Android 2.2 was released in May 2010, nearly 7 years ago, we hope that this change does not affect all too many users.\n\n\nIndoor mode\n\n\nLong pressing the lock icon will cycle through:\n\n\n\n\nNormal editing mode\n\n\nTag only mode\n\n\nIndoor editing mode\n\n\n\n\nIn indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesn\u2019t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). \n\n\nChanged \"Geometry Improvement Handle\" behaviour\n\n\nGeometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: \n\n\n\n\nSelect way\n\n\nDrag handle (default rendering is a red x)\n\n\nWay remains selected\n\n\nDrag handle\n\n\n.. and so on ...\n\n\n\n\nThe trade-off is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.\n\n\nOpening hours editor\n\n\nOn devices with Android 3.1 and later, opening_hours, service_times and collection_times tags can be created and edited with a form interface. Opening hour strings will be auto corrected if possible. The UI for this is still in development, but is already very usable.

More documentation can be found on device or \nhere\n.\n\n\nPreset based filter\n\n\nAn alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog, similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group).\n\n\nScripting\n\n\nPresets now support a \"javascript\" property that allows a script to manipulate tags, for example a \"check_date\" tag can be auto filled with the current date. An \nexample preset\n.  Outside of the use in presets, scripts can be run in an expanded mode via the \"JS Console\". This is currently of limited usefulness as there is no documentation, however it is intended to add that for future releases.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\nthe \"Find\" search function now supports Photon based geocoders.

            "text": "Main Vespucci Screen\n\n\nThe main Vespucci map screen is your normal starting point for interacting with the application. It can be in two modes\n\n\n locked\n\n\nIn this mode modifying the OpenStreetMap data is disabled, you can however use all the menus and other functions, for example down- or up-load data. The main reason to use this mode is to pan and zoom in high density areas, or to avoid accidental changes when pocketing your device. \n\n\nTapping the lock icon will toggle the mode.\n\n\n unlocked\n\n\nIn this mode you can add and change the geometry and tags of OpenStreetMap data. \nYou will still need to zoom in till editing is enabled.\n\n\nIf a small \"T\" is displayed on the lock icon you are in \"Tag editing only\" mode and will not be able to create new objects of change geometries, a small \"I\" indicates indoor mapping mode. A long press on the icon will switch to the next available and eventually cycle back to the normal unlocked mode..\n\n\nThe lock icon will always be located in the upper left corner of your devices screen. The placement of the following controls will depend on the size, orientation and age of your device, and may be in the top or bottom bar, or in a menu. \n\n\nMap and Data display\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded some OSM data you will see it displayed over a configurable background layer. The default background is the standard \"Mapnik\" style map provided by openstreetmap.org, however you can choose a different background or none from the Preferences. The style of the OSM data displayed on top of the background layer can be fully customized, however the standard \"Color round nodes\" or for \"Pen round nodes\" should work for most situations, the latter has smaller \"touch areas\" mainly for working with a pen. Depending on the device it may however work better for you.\n\n\nNote: the map tiles are cached on device and only deleted if explicitly flushed.

In general is it best to avoid them happening, particularly in areas with lots of editing activity by downloading only small areas, refreshing them often and saving changes frequently.\n\n\nVespucci uploads modified and deleted elements one by one. Any conflicts detected will be related to the current element and will need to be resolved before the upload can be retried. As a consequence, if you suspect that your edits have caused more than a handful of conflicts you should save the edits either by saving to a JOSM compatible OSM file or by exporting the changes to a OSC file and then try to resolve the conflicts in JOSM.\n\n\nVersion conflicts\n\n\nThe most common conflict is when an object has been modified or deleted while you were editing and the version number of the object that you modified is lower than the current one on the OpenStreetMap servers. In such a case you will be presented with the options to cancel, use your local version or to overwrite your changes with whatever is on the server.\n\n\nIt is likely better, except if you have really important changes, to use the remote version. If you use the local version you will overwrite whatever changes have been made by other mappers. Note that if the object has been deleted on the server and you choose to use the server version, with other words, delete the object locally, this may cause further conflicts if the object in question was a member of a way or relation.\n\n\nReferential conflicts\n\n\nWhile Vespucci in general doesn't allow this to happen, a referential conflict happens when you delete an object locally, the server however still has objects that refer to the deleted one, which haven't been modified accordingly. Deletes happen at the end of the upload process for this reason to allow the server to check. In such a conflict situation you only have the choice to use the server version or cancel.",

The editor takes this in to account by trying to hide the more obscure features in menus and most of the time reducing the \"on the road\" use to small customizations of pre-defined templates.\n\n\nThis documentation is preliminary and a work in progress\n\n\nUsing the opening hours editor\n\n\nIn a typical workflow the object you are editing will either already have an opening hours tag (opening_hours, service_times and collection_times) or you can re-apply the preset for the object to get an empty opening hours field. If you need to add the field manually and you are using Vespucci you can enter the key on the details page and then switch back to the form based tab to edit.

Particularly with the new preset driven tagging interface presets have become even more important and if you are writing presets yourself and want them to work well in Vespucci please keep on reading.\n\n\nPreset-Driven Tag-Editing in Vespucci\n\n\n\n\nFor the preset based editing to work Vespucci has to match the existing tags, including incomplete, key-only ones with the available presets. This is done in an iterative fashion: the best matching preset is found (weighting presets with fixed key-value tuples higher than such with variable values), then all tags that can be found in linked presets are added (no separate header displayed) and this process is repeated until their are either no tags left or no preset match can be found.  \n\n\nSupported JOSM Preset Elements and Attributes\n\n\nNote: this is loosely based on what \nJOSM claims\n to works, this may, and actually likely is, different from the actual implementation. Language specific attributes are ignored (see \nTranslation\n). \"supported\" doesn't necessarily imply the same behaviour as JOSM, simply that Vespucci will do something useful with the value.

            "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci?\n\n\nVespucci is the first \nOpenStreetMap\n editor for Android.\nThat means: it is a light-weight, easy-to-use mapping tool on mobile Android devices.\n\n\nWhat is Vespucci NOT?\n\n\n\n\nVespucci is not primarily a mobile map-viewer. \n\n\nVespucci is not a mobile navigation solution. It does not feature any routing algorithm.\n\n\nVespucci is not a full replacement for JOSM or other desktop editors, but nearly. It strives for maximum usability on mobile devices which are limited in many regards. \n\n\n\n\nI am already familiar with OSM editor xyz. Why should I use Vespucci?\n\n\nIf you are mapping for OSM and already have an Android device (or planning for this) then Vespucci could help in your mapping work. Data is acquired \"on site\" and uploaded to the OSM server. By entering data in your mobile device \"on the road\" you can save time because you do not have to upload GPS tracks to your home PC and work your way again through these.\nAdditionally, obscure OSM data can be verified easily and quickly \"on site\", data which is already available in OSM is not acquired again.\n\n\nWhat do I need to get started with Vespucci?\n\n\nYou need:\n\n\n\n\nAn Android device (or the emulator), note that Release 0.9.x has only been tested on Android 2.3 and later\n\n\nThe Vespucci APK file (available from Google Play and GitHub)\n\n\nSome familiarity with \nOSM Map features\n\n\nAn \nOSM account\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the status of Vespucci development?\n\n\nThe current Vespucci version is 0.9.9, 0.9.10 is currently in beta release.\n\n\nIs Vespucci available for other mobile platforms?\n\n\nNo, with the exception of those that provide an Android compatible environment.\n\n\nHow can I obtain Vespucci?\n\n\nSee \nObtaining Vespucci\n.\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on my Android device?\n\n\nJust download and install like any other app =)\n\n\nWhich special permissions does Vespucci require?\n\n\n\n\nfine location (GPS): to be able to pan the map to your current position and generate GPX format tracks\n\n\nwrite to external storage: background imagery tiles are stored, if present, on external storage, removing this permission will make the background process that downloads tiles non-functional\n\n\n\n\nVespucci warning that it cannot write to an external SD card\n\n\nVespucci preferentially attempts to store aerial imagery data on an external SD card if present, this is slower but leaves expensive internal storage free. On some devices this seems to cause persistent issues that are not resolved by giving the app permissions to write to external storage. A potential workaround is to remove the SD card (if this works in your setup), and then run vespucci. If that works and background imagery is displayed you can reinsert the SD card and vespucci should continue to use the internal storage.\n\n\nHow can I install Vespucci on the Android emulator?\n\n\nInstallation of the Vespucci APK is like any other APK.\nThere are plenty of descriptions available (e.g. \n1 \n, \n2 \n, \n3 \n, \n4 \n)\n\n\nRunning Vespucci on \"old and small\" devices\n\n\nModern (0.8 and up) Vespucci versions have been tested and found to work on Android 2.3 (2.2 was last supported in version 0.9.8) and later,\nhowever older devices tend to have very limited memory and correspondingly the apps are allocated very small amounts of heap (this can be as low as 16MB). If you are trying to run Vespucci on such a device, particularly with 0.9.4 and later, the following hints should be helpful (ordered in decreasing order of importance):\n\n\n\n\nturn off any map overlay\n\n\nonly load small map areas and don't excessively use the incremental load facility\n\n\nturn off notes and photo overlay\n\n\nturn off name suggestions\n\n\ndon't add large presets\n\n\n\n\nCan't download data from OpenStreetMap servers\n\n\nIf it is not a connectivity issue you may be running in to the following problem: current Vespucci versions use HTTPS (encrypted connections) to connect to the OpenStreetMap servers, if you are running on an older Android version this may be failing due to problems the old devices have with more recent certificates. \n\n\nWorkaround: create a new non-HTTPS API entry (enter \"http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/\" as API URL) and select that. 0.9.8 and later versions already have such an entry, you only need to activate it. \n\n\nNote that the same issue may apply to certain background and overlay layers.\n\n\n\"301 Moved Permanently\" error when trying to download\n\n\nThe OpenStreetMap API server you are using is likely redirecting HTTP (non-encrypted) to HTTPS (encrypted) connections. Try changing the API configuration to use HTTPS.\n\n\nWhat can I do with the editor?\n\n\nCurrently, you can:\n\n\n\n\nAdd and move nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nRotate ways\n\n\nEdit the tags of nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nAppend nodes to existing ways\n\n\nDelete existing nodes, ways and relations\n\n\nMerge nodes\n\n\nEdit existing relation members and add new \n\n\nAdd turn restrictions\n\n\nDownload area around current location from OSM server\n\n\nDownload user-specified areas from OSM server\n\n\nCreate, save, upload and import GPS tracks\n\n\n\n\n... and much more.\n\n\nDoes Vespucci support OSM Notes?\n\n\nYes, Vespucci supports manual and automatic download of Notes and offline storage of them, further it supports displaying and editing warnings produced by the OSMOSE quality assurance system. OpenStreetBugs is no longer supported.\n\n\nWhat are the limits of Vespucci?\n\n\nSome things missing at this point in time:\n\n\n\n\nNo validator (however in general Vespucci tries to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot)\n\n\nSome operations still missing, for example polygon merging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, Android is intended to be lightweight and easy-to-use.\n\n\n\n\nWhich languages are supported?\n\n\nThe user interface is currently available in: English, German, Chinese (Taiwan), Spanish, Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish, French, Italian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Portuguese and Japanese. These translations are typically complete or only have a small number of terms missing.\n\n\nWe also have partial translations for a number of other languages (please see link to Transifex below for the current status). If the translation for your language is incomplete or missing, please feel free to request the language on Transifex and start translating. Any help in this area would be gratefully received. Please see \nVespucci's Transifex page\n to help.\n\n\nHow can I download OSM data?\n\n\nOn the first time startup, Vespucci requests which area to download. You can choose from the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCurrent location\n\n\nLast known location\n\n\nCoordinates. If you need access to specific geographic coordinates you can specify latitude/longitude.\n\n\nSearch for a location (New in 0.9.4, requires network connectivity)\n\n\n\n\nFor all download options, the additional parameter \"Radius\" is used. It specifies how large the downloaded area is. (In detail: Radius is half the side length of the bounding box that is used when downloading.)\n\n\nYou can alternatively dismiss the dialog, zoom and pan to the area in question and then select the \"Download current view\" from the transfer menu.\n\n\nHow can I upload new/changed data to the OSM server?\n\n\nChoose \"Upload data to  OSM server\" from the transfer menu.\n(With other words: Data is not automatically uploaded!)\n\n\nWhich user account is used when uploading data to the OSM server?\n\n\nVespucci uses OAuth authorization by default for new installations. On your first upload you will be directed to an OSM page where you will need to grant Vespucci permission to use your OpenStreetMap account. It is not necessary nor recommended to store username/password on your device (it is however possible if OAuth causes problems for whatever reasons).\n\n\nNote: OAuth will work for both the standard API and the development servers, if you are running your own or need to access a third party site with OAuth you need to add the corresponding secrets to the API configuration and rebuild Vespucci.\n\n\nHow can I zoom into an area?\n\n\n\n\nUse the pinch-to-zoom multi-touch gesture.\n\n\nUse the on-screen zoom controls.\n\n\nUse the volume buttons of your Android device.\n\n\n\n\nConflict resolution\n\n\nVespucci has a built in conflict resolution capability. If you want finer grain control over the resolution process you can export all your changes to a .osm file, open that with JOSM and use JOSM's conflict resolution capabilities.\n\n\nCan't enter key with MessageEase\n\n\nWhen word prediction is turned on in MessageEase it causes issues entering text for keys in the \"Details\" tab, disabling word prediction allows it to work.\n\n\nWhy do I have to have GPS turned on?\n\n\nYou don't. You can return to the app and continue working by pressing the back button when the system asks you to turn on GPS (location based functions will not work). \n\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that we assume that typical use is an on the ground survey and that you will want your current position to be displayed on the map. As a result the standard behaviour is to ask you (once) on start up of the app to turn GPS on, you can however disable this in the \"Advanced Preferences\" in the GPS section, by setting the \"Leave GPS off\" preference. \n\n\nThe translation for language X is incomplete or wrong!\n\n\nVespucci is a community developed, open source, project. While not everybody will be able to contribute to the code, everybody should be able to work on the translations on \n\ntransifex\n. Translations in the app are updated typically once a month.  \n\n\nThe translation for the presets is broken!\n\n\nThe preset translations tend to be a work in progress and given that a large number (over 2'300) of terms have to be translates, many are incomplete. If you want to use an untranslated preset instead, you can install one via the help page for presets (link at the bottom of the page).\n\n\nPresets for military objects are missing!\n\n\nDue to the touchy situation having pre-defined presets for military objects on device could create you need to download them and install them yourself. You can find a link at the bottom of the preset help page.\n\n\nFullscreen mode doesn't work properly\n\n\nFullscreen mode on Android is a bit hit and miss (depending on Android version and device) as it is really designed for games and for apps without keyboard use. If the Android buttons are hidden, the standard Android way to show them, at least in recent Android versions, is a swipe from the bottom edge. \n\n\nIf fullscreen mode is causing issues for you, the best solution is to simply turn it off in the \"Advanced preferences\". \n\n\nVespucci is getting slower and slower\n\n\nAdding more data via the auto-download facility and/or the menu item \"Add current view to download\" increases the amount of the data retained in memory. Due to the way Android works this has to be saved and re-loaded in a number of situations, including, naturally, on restart of the app. Further certain operations that need to select a subset of the data in memory can be impacted by this slow down too. \n\n\nRecommended practice, if you no longer need the previously loaded data and have uploaded all edits, is to reset the data in memory by using the \"Download current view\" action.\n\n\nHow can I add a custom (aerial/satellite) imagery layer\n\n\nThe preferred method is to add your imagery source to \nthe editor layer index\n so that it can be used by all OpenStreetMap editors.\n\n\nHowever you can add a file 'imagery.json' containing custom sources in the legacy editor-layer-index format in the Vespucci folder on your device. See \nsample file on google drive\n.  \n\n\nWhy can't you provide technical support on the google play store review section\n\n\nThe google play store allows just one reply to a review with a maximum length of just 350 characters. If you believe that what you are experiencing is a clear malfunction please open a new issue on \ngithub\n, if you have questions or can't find how do a specific operation you can ask on the \nOpenStreetMap help site\n or one of the other OpenStreetMap communication channels. \n\n\n350 characters is 100 characters less than the text above.",
