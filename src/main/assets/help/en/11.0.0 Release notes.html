<h1>Vespucci 11.0 BETA Highlights</h1><h2>Layer control</h2><p>The most obvious visual difference in version 11 is the layer control on the main map view. </p><p>Currently it is not possible to change the ordering or add more than one layer of a specific type, supported functionality: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Hide/Show button turns drawing of the layer off/on. Hiding a layer doesn't free any resources associated with the layer.</li>
  <li>Zoom to extent. Zooms and pans the screen so that the whole extent of the layer is displayed, if the extent cannot be determined this will zoom out to the full web-mercator coverage. Note: on the data layer this may not be particularly useful if you have downloaded areas that are far apart.</li>
  <li>Menu button.
  <ul>
    <li>Tile based layers:
    <ul>
      <li>Select imagery. Same contents as on the prefernce screen, if multiple layers have been used, a most-recently-used list will be displayed above this menu entry, allowing quick layer switching. Selecting the "None" entry from the list will disable the layer, and requires re-enabling it via the "+" button on the layer dialog.</li>
      <li>Flush tile cache. Moved here from main menu.</li>
      <li>Background properties. Set contrast of layer, moved here from main menu.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>GeoJSON layer.
    <ul>
      <li>Change style. Show the layer styling dialog.</li>
      <li>Discard. Delete the layer including any saved state.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>GPX layer. The GPX layer is currently mainly controlled via the entries in the GPS menu.
    <ul>
      <li>Change style. Show the layer styling dialog.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Photo, Grid and Task layers.
    <ul>
      <li>Disable. Turn this layer off, needs to be re-anbled via proferences. For the tasks and photo layers this will free resources if the app is exited and re-started.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>"+" button:
  <ul>
    <li>Load GeoJSON layer. Loads a GeoJSON layer from a file, any existing one will be replaced.</li>
    <li>Map background. Shown if the background layer has been disabled, allows the same selection as from the preferences screen.</li>
    <li>Map overlay. Shown if the overlay layer has been disabled, allows the same selection as from the preferences screen.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2>Support for GeoJSON layers</h2><p>A single (currently) GeoJSON based layer can be displayed on the map, individual elements are selectable. On loading the GeoJSON data from a file colour, stroke width and a tag for displaying a label can be selected.</p><p>A typical use case would be to verify third party data in GeoJSON format on the ground and similar mapping activities. </p><h2>Re-arranged Preferences</h2><p>The two preferences screens have been re-arranged with just the most important settings on the first screen and the "Advanced preference" screen split up in to multiple sub-screens.</p><p>The Authors and Licence screen has been move to the main menu, just as the Debug screen has.</p><h2>Undo/redo of individual checkpoints</h2><p>Previously selecting an undo or redo checkpoint from the undo menu (long press on the undo icon), undid/redid all checkpoints back to that point in time. In Vespucci 11 a dialog is shown that will either select the previous behaviour or allow undoing/redoing just the single selected checkpoint.</p><p>While selecting just one checkpoint is in general safe to do, it may have unintended consequences as all elements changed in the checkpoint will be reinstated to the stored state when the checkpoint was created. </p><p>Note: removing/adding objects to relations will cause a copy of the the directly involved relations with, in turn, their relation memberships to be stored. Such "one level away" relations may however have been removed in later edits. if such a situation is detected the affected relation membership is ignored silently and not re-instated.</p><h2>Review changes before upload</h2><p>Entries on the list of the created, changed and deleted elements can now be selected and the actual changes inspected. Elements that have failed the validator tests will have a red icon displayed. </p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for icons in preset combos and multi-selects.</li>
  <li>The info display for selected elements will now show the original state of the element side by side with the current state if the element has been modified.</li>
