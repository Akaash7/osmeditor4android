<h1>Vespucci 0.9.9 "malenki" Highlights</h1><p>This release is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Bellmann "malenki" an engaged OpenStreetMap contributor and Vespucci user.</p><h2>"End of life" Android 2.2 / API 8 support</h2><p>Release 0.9.9 will likely be the last release that, at least in theory, supports Android 2.2. Google has removed 2.2 support from the libraries we use to provide backwards compatible support and there doesn't seem to be a way that we can replace them in any reasonable fashion. Even as is, we cannot use the latest version of these libraries that would match the Android version we are building against.</p><p>As Android 2.2 was released in May, 2010 nearly 7 years ago, we hope that this change does not affect all too many users.</p><h2>Indoor Mode</h2><p>Long pressing the lock icon will cycle through</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal editing mode</li>
  <li>Tag only mode</li>
  <li>Indoor editing mode</li>
</ul><p>In indoor mode the displayed level can be changed with the up/down buttons, tapping the level display button will show everything that doesnâ€™t have a level tag (roughly, it is slightly more complicated than that). </p><h2>Changed "Geometry Improvement Handle" behaviour</h2><p>Geometry improvement handles on ways now work as they do with iD: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Select way</li>
  <li>Drag handle (default rendering is a red x)</li>
  <li>Way remains selected</li>
  <li>Drag handle</li>
  <li>.. and so on ...</li>
</ul><p>The tradeoff is that now more care has to be exercised when dragging ways.</p><h2>Tag based filter</h2><p>The filter can be enabled from the normal main menu, the filter can then be changed by tapping the filter icon. More documentation can be found on device or <a href="https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/blob/master/documentation/docs/help/en/Tag%20filter.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Preset based filter</h2><p>An alternative to the above, objects are filtered either on individual presets or on preset groups. Tapping on the filter icon will display a preset selection dialog, similar to that used elsewhere in Vespucci. Individual presets can be selected by a normal click, preset groups by a long click (normal click enters the group).</p><h2>Scripting</h2><p>Presets now support a "javascript" property that allows a script to manipulate tags, for example a "check_date" tag can be auto filled with the current date. An example preset is available <a href="https://github.com/simonpoole/preset-scripting-examples">here</a>. Outside of the use in presets scripts can be run in an expanded mode via the "JS Console", this is currently of limited usefulness as there is no documentation, however it is intended to add that for release.</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
  <li>the "Find" search function now supports Photon based geocoders. The default configuration of the OSMF Nominatim and komoots Photon instances can be changed in the advanced preferences.</li>
  <li>presets support a "deprecated" property that allows them to be matched for the map display and in the form-based tag editor, but they are not offered and found for new use.</li>
  <li>support for opening a photo viewer in the adjacent window on Android N and later.</li>
  <li>a lot of work has been done to make it easier to contribute to Vespucci, this includes migrating to the new standard Android project layout, making more operations available via gradle tasks and adding tests for a substantial part of the code.</li>
</ul><p>The full change log is available <a href="https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/commits/master">here</a></p><h1>Known Problems</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Due to a change in the way Android N handles Uri that reference on device files it may not be possible to display photos that are not in the Vespucci folder.</li>
</ul><h1>Upgrading from previous Versions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The saved editing state file format has changed, please complete any edits before upgrading.</li>
  <li>For known problems with the beta build please see <a href="https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues">our issue tracker</a></li>
