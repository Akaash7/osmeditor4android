<h1>Vespucci 12.0 EARLY BETA Highlights</h1>
<h2>Simple action mode</h2>
<p>Simple action mode replaces the long click action on the screen with a menu driven way of creating new objects. Long clicks are disabled as long as the mode is active.</p>
<p>Tapping the large green floating button will show a menu. After you've selected one of the items, you will be asked to tap the screen at the location where you want to create the object, pan and zoom continues to work if you need to adjust the map view. </p>
<p>The mode can be toggled on and off via an item in the main menu.</p>
<h2>Support for MapRoulette</h2>
<p>MapRoulette tasks are now supported in the task overlay. </p>
<p>To be able to change a tasks status you will need to set you API key. If you have not set it, you will be asked on first upload, preferably you should set the key before making any changes via the "Tools" menu.</p>
